This Streamlit app helps users estimate their **monthly mortgage payments**, **total repayment**, and **total interest paid** based on user inputs. It also visualizes the **remaining loan balance over time**.

Enter the **home price**, **down payment**, **interest rate**, and **loan term** to see payment breakdowns and a loan balance chart. The app includes built-in error handling for invalid inputs.
